## Interact

An additional part of the modification. Interacts with the game's API automatically (so you **may be banned** for using them, be careful)

All interactions use a general timer, configurable in the settings (500ms by default). Values ​​below **250ms** will often lead to temporary blocking from servers, so I don't recommend it.

Completely disabled by default.

### Auto fill bildings

Automatically puts resources from your drone into buildings that:

1. Can accept them
2. Can use them (for example, generators, but not containers)

If `Allow interact with core automatically` is enabled:

1. Takes resources from cores if nearby buildings need them
2. Puts resources back to core if they don't fit

Everything is quite simple: for generators, the first suitable resource is selected (for example, coal for combustion), for turrets — best ammo, for everything else all's clear
